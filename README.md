# Fabula Ultima Chanter Musical Expansion

This Foundry VTT addon expands the Chanter class in Fabula Ultima, allowing you to play songs when performing chants. For each Key, you can set a song title for every tone/tune. When a Chanter uses a chant, the corresponding song will be played from the selected playlist.

## How does it work?

- In each Key item, you can enter a song title for every tone/tune (e.g. Calm Tone, Energetic Tone, etc.).
- The playlist name must be specified in the Chanter class item (not the actor).
- The playlist must already exist in Foundry and be filled with the songs you want to use. Song titles must match the names of the tracks in the playlist exactly.
- When a chant is performed, the module automatically plays the matching song from the playlist.

## Requirements

- The [Fabula Ultima ProjectFU system](https://github.com/League-of-Fabulous-Developers/FoundryVTT-Fabula-Ultima) must be installed and active.
- You need to create your playlist and add all desired songs in Foundry VTT before using this addon.
