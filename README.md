# Fabula Ultima Chanter Musical Expansion

This Foundry VTT addon expands the Chanter class in Fabula Ultima, allowing you to play songs when performing chants. For each Key, you can set a song title for every tone/tune. When the Chanter uses a chant, the corresponding song will be played from the selected playlist.

## How does it work?

- In each Key item, you can enter a song title for every tone/tune (e.g. Calm Tone, Energetic Tone, etc.) or select a sound-file using the note button.
- If you want to use songs from a playlist, the playlist name must be specified in the Chanter class item.
- The playlist must already exist in Foundry and be filled with the songs you want to use. Song titles must match the names of the tracks in the playlist exactly.
- When a chant is performed, the module automatically plays the matching song.

## Requirements

- The [Fabula Ultima ProjectFU system](https://github.com/League-of-Fabulous-Developers/FoundryVTT-Fabula-Ultima) must be installed and active.
- You need to create your playlist and add all desired songs in Foundry VTT before using this addon, if you want to use songs from a playlist.
